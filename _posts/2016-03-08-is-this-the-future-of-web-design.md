Is this the future of web design?

Since I've been involved in the Internet from 1994 (and BBS's before that). I've seen some huge changes in the web, how it's constructed and how it's consumed. Arguably in the last decade the biggest game changer was the smartphone with the original iPhone, and continues to innovate and mold how we build websites.

In this decade, at least as it stands now, the next game changer is this - AI - and how The Grid enables us to interface with an AI to construct and design web pages.

What does this mean for roles in the industry? Who knows is the short answer. It's still obviously way too early to tell, but with all leaps of technology there will be people caught out with obsolete skills (think Industrial Revolution, computers, car factory robots).
